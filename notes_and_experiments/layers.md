# Web app layers

On this page, **bulletpoint** is a single layer than can be toggled on and off. Each layer also includes tags in square brackets to highlight groups they may be of interest to/how they might be combined. Sub-bulletpoints are **not** extra layers, they are just clarification.

## Awareness category

- Combined visibility viewshed heatmap 9entire park area, not restricted to paths): [1]
    - Visibility of 0: no line of sight to any entrance;
    - Visibility of X: line of sight to X entrances.
- Remoteness layer: analysis of access/distance along paths to park entrances, incorporating slope [1]
- Lighting layer: either a very simple point-per-lightsource, or a heatmap where each lightsource gets a buffer, could get tricky with line-of-sight. [1]



[1]: These layers can be grouped to highlight general visibility, perhaps in an index heatmap for the park.
