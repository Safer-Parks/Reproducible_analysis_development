# Web app layers

- In the layers section below, each **bulletpoint** represents a single layer than can be toggled on and off.
- Each layer includes numbered tags in square brackets to highlight groups they may be of interest to/how they might be combined with the legend below.
- Each layer includes thematic tags that might be useful for ordering in the legend.
- Sub-bulletpoints are **not** extra layers, they are just clarification.
- The order they are shown in below doesn't imply the order they will be visible in on the legend, we can rearrange or re-order as needed.

## Layers

- Point-to-entrance combined visibility viewshed heatmap (entire park area, not restricted to paths): [escape, 1]
    - Visibility of 0: no line of sight to any entrance;
    - Visibility of X: line of sight to X entrances.
- Remoteness layer: analysis of access/distance along paths to park entrances, incorporating slope - might not be particularly useful, can get rid of this [escape, 3]
- Basic path network layer [belonging, 3]
- Lighting layer: either a very simple point-per-lightsource, or a heatmap where each lightsource gets a buffer, could get tricky with line-of-sight. [1, 2]
- Point-to-point combined visibility viewshed heatmap (entire park area, not restricted to paths) [2]
- Signage and maps [1, 2]




[1]: These layers can be grouped to highlight openness and escape routes from park.

- These can be accompanied by design guidance around maintaining trees and shrubs
    - Might it be possible to have two different results, one that uses "poorly maintained trees" (where we make the obstacle bigger, assuming it's not just trunks) vs "well maintained trees" where it's assumed all branches etc. are above head height? Plus the same for shrubs. We don't need to *know* this, but it allows users to see what the difference is and whether it's important or not?
- Can be accompanied by guidance suggesting ensuring more "isolated" areas have good signage
- Guidance advising comparing path networks [3] with areas of low visibility, and "safety desire paths" 

[2]: These layers can be combined to find gathering spaces, and to see if facilities and lighting are sensibly placed in these areas

- Can be accompanied by guidance around good places to add signage, benches, lighting
- Guidance advising comparing path networks [3] with access to these areas, suggest path networks connect these areas

[3]: These layers can highlight park usage for "path users" when shown alongside other groupings. Path users either favour or have to use path networks. This can include wheelchair users, pushchair users, or wintertime park users when the the grass is difficult to cross.

- How do highlighted/favourable areas correlate or not with path networks?
- Do path users miss out on any park features?
- Guidance on using other layers to inform decisions around adding/moving paths.
